# Changelog

## 1.0.1 (unreleased)

- Fix `FileNotFoundError` when using blobs with `transaction.savepoint()` (e.g. plone.exportimport content import). Blob files are now staged to a stable location before the caller can delete them. [#1]

## 1.0.0

### Added

- **State processor plugin system**: Register processors that extract extra
  column data from object state during writes. This enables downstream
  packages (e.g. plone-pgcatalog) to write supplementary columns alongside
  the object state in a single atomic `INSERT...ON CONFLICT` statement.

  New public API:

  - `ExtraColumn(name, value_expr, update_expr=None)` dataclass — declares
    an extra column for `object_state`.
  - `PGJsonbStorage.register_state_processor(processor)` — registers a
    processor whose `process(zoid, class_mod, class_name, state)` method
    can pop keys from the state dict and return extra column data.

  Processors are called in `store()` after pickle-to-JSON decoding.
  Extra columns are included in the pipelined `executemany()` batch write
  during `tpc_vote()`, keeping everything in the same PostgreSQL
  transaction for full atomicity.

- **State processor DDL via `get_schema_sql()`**: Processors can now
  optionally provide a `get_schema_sql()` method returning DDL statements
  (e.g. `ALTER TABLE`, `CREATE INDEX`). The DDL is applied using the
  storage's own connection during `register_state_processor()`, avoiding
  REPEATABLE READ lock conflicts with pool connections.

### Optimized

- **Batch conflict detection**: Conflict checks are now batched into a
  single `SELECT ... WHERE zoid = ANY(...)` query in `tpc_vote()` instead
  of individual per-object queries in `store()`. Eliminates N-1 SQL
  round trips per transaction while holding the advisory lock.

- **Prepared statements**: Added `prepare=True` to hot-path queries
  (`load`, `loadSerial`, `loadBefore`) for faster repeated execution.

- **Removed GIN index on state JSONB**: The `jsonb_path_ops` GIN index
  indexed every key-path and value, causing significant write amplification.
  With plone-pgcatalog providing dedicated query columns, direct state
  JSONB queries are no longer needed in production.

## 1.0.0a1

Initial feature-complete release.

### Added

- **Core IStorage**: Full two-phase commit (2PC) with ZODB.DB integration.
- **IMVCCStorage**: Per-connection MVCC instances with REPEATABLE READ
  snapshot isolation and advisory lock TID serialization.
- **IBlobStorage**: Blob support using PostgreSQL bytea with deterministic
  filenames for `Blob.committed()` compatibility.
- **S3 tiered blob storage**: Configurable threshold to offload large blobs
  to S3 while keeping small blobs in PostgreSQL.
- **History-preserving mode**: Dual-write to `object_state` and
  `object_history` with full `IStorageUndoable` support (undo, undoLog,
  undoInfo).
- **IStorageIteration / IStorageRestoreable**: Transaction and record
  iteration for backup/restore tooling.
- **Conflict resolution**: Inherited `tryToResolveConflict` with serial
  cache for correct `loadSerial` during conflict resolution.
- **ZConfig integration**: `%import zodb_pgjsonb` with `<pgjsonb>` section
  for Zope/Plone deployments.
- **PG null-byte sanitization**: Automatic `\u0000` handling with `@ns`
  marker for JSONB compatibility.

### Optimized

- **LRU load cache**: Configurable in-memory cache for `load()` calls.
- **Connection pooling**: psycopg3 connection pool with configurable size.
- **Batch SQL writes**: `executemany()` for pipelined store performance
  during `tpc_vote()`.
- **Single-pass store**: `decode_zodb_record_for_pg` for combined class
  extraction and state decoding.
- **Reduced default cache**: 16 MB per instance (down from 64 MB).
